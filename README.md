# NETFLIX-DASHBOARD

As a data analyst and ardent Netflix subscriber, I was interested in exploring the streaming platform’s vast library of content from 2008 to 2021 and uncovering some insights.
Using Tableau, I created a Netflix visualisation dashboard that analyses the data on the platform’s movies and TV shows.

My visualisation explored a variety of data points, including the total number of movies and TV Shows on Netflix by year, as well as by country. I also delved into the ratings and identified the top 10 genres of content available.

One of the main insights I gleaned from my analysis was that Netflix has seen a significant increase in the number of movies and TV shows available on its platform in recent years. The number of titles has more than doubled since 2015, thus indicating an increase in the platform’s usage.

I also found that Netflix content is diverse, with titles available from countries all over the world. While the United States dominates the list with the highest number of titles, there are significant contributions from other countries such as India, the United Kingdom, Canada and France.

Furthermore, my analysis showed that the most popular genres on Netflix are Dramas, Documentaries and Comedy with a significant number of titles falling into these categories.

Overall, my Netflix dashboard is a powerful too for showcasing my data analysis skills using Tableau. It provides a fascinating glimpse into the world of Netflix and its wide range of content, and I am excited to share it.

The dashboard can be interacted with on Tableau.
